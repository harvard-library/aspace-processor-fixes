# Fixes for Archivesspace Preprocessor

This repository contains fixes for use with the [ArchivesSpace Preprocessor](http://github.com/harvard-library/archivesspace-preprocessor), 
along with test case EADs for each fix and a schematron file for detecting the issues the fixes apply to. These reflect Harvard-specific practice, 
but largely reflect problems that prevent ingest or proper parsing by ArchivesSpace, and may be generally relevant.
