         <abstract>This collection documents the effects that chestnut blight, also known as
                chestnut tree bark disease, had on chestnut trees throughout Pennsylvania. The
                photos of primarily diseased chestnut trees were taken by the Pennsylvania Chestnut
                Tree Blight Commission ca. 1912 and 1913.</abstract>

         <p>This collection documents the effects that chestnut blight, also known as chestnut
                tree bark disease, had on chestnut trees throughout
                    <geogname>Pennsylvania</geogname>. Introduced in the <geogname>United
                    States</geogname> in the early 20th century, the first signs of the fungus were
                discovered in <geogname>New York City</geogname> in <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1904</date>, and by <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1912</date> it
                was observed in points as far apart as eastern <geogname>Massachusetts</geogname>
                and northern <geogname>Virginia</geogname>. Concern over the destruction of trees
                and subsequent effects to state and local economies led to a conference in
                    <geogname>Harrisburg, Pennsylvania</geogname>, that was held on <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">February 20 and 21, 1912</date>, and was called by
                    <persname>John K. Tener</persname> (<date calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1863/1946" type="life">1863-1946</date>), who was governor of
                    <geogname>Pennsylvania</geogname> from <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1911/1915">1911 to 1915</date>. Chestnut trees were used to make tannic
                acid (used in tanning), telegraph and telephone poles, and railroad ties, and
                chestnuts themselves were harvested for consumption, so a shortage of the trees was
                not insignificant. </p>
         <p>The <corpname>Pennsylvania Chestnut Tree Blight Commission</corpname>, also known as
                the Pennsylvania Chestnut Blight Commission, was commissioned by Tener to stop the
                spread of chestnut blight and eradicate the disease in the western part of the state
                (approximately 6.5 million acres of woodland). With the <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">June 1911</date> bill that established the commission, he committed
                $275,000 to its efforts to stop the blight from moving west. <persname>Mark Alfred
                    Carlton</persname> managed the project, sending two hundred field agents to
                inspect trees in western counties; in eastern counties, tree surgeons advised
                homeowners on ways to save their ornamental chestnut trees from blight. In the west,
                over 50,000 infected trees were destroyed. In the east, the diseased portions of
                trees were removed and the resulting wounds covered with creosote. The commission
                disbanded in <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">August of 1913</date> after
                requests for another $275,000 were denied. </p>
         <p>
            <persname>Winthrop Sargent</persname> (<date calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="18530818/19320329" type="life">August 18, 1853-March 29, 1932</date>)
                served as chairman of the commission during its brief existence. A cousin of
                    <corpname>Arnold Arboretum</corpname> director <persname>Charles Sprague
                    Sargent</persname> (<date calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1841/1927" type="life">1841-1927</date>) and painter <persname>John Singer
                    Sargent</persname> (<date calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1856/1925" type="life">1856-1925</date>), he was a <geogname>Pennsylvania</geogname>
                native. During his lifetime he was involved in various industries, including the
                railroad, paint, cement, and coal. While he helped lead the effort to save
                    <name>Pennsylvania</name>’s chestnut trees, he was concerned with other forms of
                preservation as well; Sargent was instrumental in preserving an ancestor’s
                Revolutionary War-era home in <geogname>Gloucester, MA</geogname>, and he published

         <p>This collection documents the findings of the <corpname>Pennsylvania Chestnut Tree
                    Blight Commission</corpname> through a series of images that were taken ca.
                    <date calendar="gregorian" certainty="circa" era="ce">1912-1913</date> as part
                of a survey of <geogname>Pennsylvania</geogname>’s trees. Photographs of trees being
                felled and milled and sketches of the blight-causing fungus are included as well.
                The images were removed from a photo album that was given to the <corpname>Arnold
                    Arboretum</corpname> by <persname>Winthrop Sargent</persname>, chair of the

         <p>The Pennsylvania – Chestnut Tree Blight Commission, Collection of Photographs is

               <p>Note: Photographs are kept in the order in which they appeared in the
                        original album and are identified by the original caption. The numbering
                        system of the images reflects their original order. Images are first
                        identified by page number (1, 1.a, 2, etc.). Where there were multiple
                        images on one page that had the same caption, only the page number is used
                        to identify both. Where multiple images on a page had different captions,
                        the images are identified by the page number and whether they were located
                        on the right or left side of the page.</p>
